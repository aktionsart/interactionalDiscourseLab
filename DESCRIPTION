Description: The interactional discourse lab (IDLab) is a free tool available to researchers analysing spoken interaction. This web tool
    was initially developed as a novel method for the quantitative analysis of the discourse of interdisciplinary research engagement,
    but it can be used in any interactional context (e.g. classrooms, meetings, conversations).
    Uniquely, it focuses on the interaction itself, rather than on merely spoken content. The tool is still in development and currently
    provides fairly basic graphic and network representations of interactional relationships.
